### Caution Case

To register a user, once need to send JSON as following format:

```json
{
  "first_name": "Haris",
  "last_name": "Dipto",
  "email": "haris.dipto@gmail.com",
  "password": "12345",
  "birth_day": "2020-04-23T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Special case is for `birth_day` property. Its required to send date in the above mentioned format.

### Future Improvements

There are lots of cases where improvement is needed. I mostly did it for my personal usage. So I think its very less likely that I'll make those improvemnts in future. ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
